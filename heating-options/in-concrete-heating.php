      <p>Heatwell In-concrete heating is great for new homes or new concrete slab overlays. It is a radiant form of electric heating that is continuously run via thermostat control during the cooler months to keep the concrete slab warm creating a cosy environment.</p>
      <p>Heatwell uses a heavy duty electrical heating cable which is tied to the reinforcing mesh on top of a polystyrene insulation layer before the concrete slab is poured. Using an installation wattage of between 100 – 160 watts per m² utilising an automatic programmable thermostat.</p>
